# Othello – University Project (Python)

This repository contains a university project implementing the classic board game **Othello** (also known as Reversi) in Python. The main goal of the assignment was to develop a playable version of Othello where a **human player competes against a computer-controlled opponent** using a **heuristic-based decision-making algorithm**.

## 🎮 Project Overview

The game is played on an 8x8 board following standard Othello rules. The player takes turns with the AI, placing discs on the board to capture the opponent's pieces.

### Key Features:
- Player vs. Computer gameplay
- AI opponent with a basic heuristic evaluation
- Console-based
- Turn validation and disc flipping logic implemented

> ⚠️ Note: This project was developed as a **university assignment** and focuses primarily on demonstrating AI decision-making, not on advanced UI/UX.

## 🤖 AI and Heuristics

The computer opponent uses a **heuristic evaluation function** to determine its next move. The heuristic may take into account:
- Number of discs gained
- Corner and edge control
- Mobility (number of possible moves)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/davidstakic/othello-game-python.git
